# Ruby Perth

The repo is used for tracking issues related to the Ruby Perth meetup, particularly for tracking presentations and topics of interest.

Track potential [talks and topics](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). Or create a [new issue](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues/new/choose) for a talk proposal, or a topic you're interested in.

This is an issue-only repo; no code is stored here.
