# Ruby Perth

This repo is used for tracking "issues" related to the [Ruby Perth meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-perth-meetup/).

Intent for this repo is mainly to track presentation proposals and topics of interest. It will also be used for managing suggestions and enhancements to our local meetup, ensuring it's a positive and helpful experience for all. This `README` is to document the process to submit a presentation/talk proposal or request. Some of the behind-the-scenes information for the meetup is also included.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an issue-only repo. No code is stored here.

## Repo Intent

As mentioned, we're using this repo to track issues:
* View [all our currently tracked issues](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
* Proposals for [presentations/talks](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3AProposal-Talk):
  * We're always on the lookout for people who are willing to present to our local Ruby community
  * Presentations can be about anything that relates to Ruby, even if only "tangentially" related
  * Some example ideas for presentations: Ruby internals, "how to do X with Ruby", new and updated Rails features, recent changes in web development, Ruby and mobile dev, web accessibility, developer toolchains and utilities, language comparisons ([note]()), general tech industry commentary and much more
  * Also very happy for presentations from people that are "outside" of the local Ruby community - some non-exhaustive examples:
    * Academics/experts speaking about developments in computer science or computer languages
    * Web designers talking about design principles or new UI/UX concepts
    * Developer tool advocates (could be either commercial or F/OSS products - organisers to determine what's "OK" with community)
    * Disability advocates with expertise in web accessibility
    * Notable tech experts visiting Perth and willing to present
    * (There's plenty more scope here...)
  * If someone has a proposal but unsure if it's relevant or of interest? Discuss with them and (if needed) the rest of the organiser team
  * If someone is considering presenting but not sure what people want to know about? Refer them to the Topics of Interest for ideas that people have already expressed interest in knowing aboutâ€¦
* Requested [topics of interest](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3AProposal-Topic):
  * If there's a topic that someone wants to know more about? Encourage them to check the list of requested topics
  * If it already exists, they can add a :+1: to the topic
  * If it's not already present, invite them to add a topic request issue to the repo
  * This will help organisers understand what our local community members are most interested in hearing and learning about
Create an [Other Issue](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues/new/choose):
  * Noticed a problem - big or small - at a meetup event?
  * Have a suggested enhancement to the meetup(s)?
  * An idea that could make our monthly events more beneficial, welcoming or just "better" in some way?
  * Organisers should always reinforce being absolutely open to feedback
  * Want people to help us identify ways to improve our monthly events - best way is by creating a new "Other Issue"
  * If someone wants to discuss an issue privately? Encourage in-person contact at the meetup, or they can use the contact info for our organiser team belowâ€¦

## Meetup Logistics

Logistical information about our monthly meetup:
* We use meetup.com to help manage our montly events at [Ruby Perth meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-perth-meetup/)
* We meet monthly on the `2nd Wednesday of each month`
* Venue is the Fat Zebra offices (Perth CBD):
  * Floor 6, 66 St Georges Terrace, Perth
  * See meetup.com for map links and venue pictures
  * Venue is open to attendees from 5:00pm; we aim to start around 5:20pm
  * Note that the venue building security locks entry at 5:30pm
  * For attendees arriving after 5:30pm - event info should include a contact method: attendees can send a message on arrival and someone will come down promptly to let them in
* Currently no virtual meetup option - an "in-person and online" hybrid meetup arrangement is under consideration
* We order pizzas from a nearly pizzeria shortly after "officially" starting the meetup
  * ETA will be around 6~6:30pm
  * Depends on duration of initial presentation - pizza ETA should be scheduled for just after expected conclusion)
  * After conclusion of initial presentation, break for pizza consumption and socialising
* After food, additional presentation/content varies each month - can include one or more of:
  * Another presentation
  * [Lightning talk(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)
  * "Weird Ruby" - Ruby can surprise us: this is a brief segment where a small sample of "odd" Ruby code is shown and behaviour is discussed. (Concept thefted from Ruby Melbourne.)
  * Collective Coding - group coding aka "mass pairing" session where a code problem is solved using Ruby
  * Code Challenge - similar concept, but attendees individually work to solve a specific code challenge; then various solutions are shared and discussed (organisers should advise attendees in advance that a mobile device will be needed)
  * Other ideas under active consideration
  * Again - [feedback](https://github.com/rubyaustralia/meetup-ruby-perth/issues/new/choose) on other ideas is welcomed!

> [!TIP]
> Are you a Perth local and curious about Ruby? Please feel free to join us at our monthly meetup ðŸ˜ƒ
> Interested but unable to join us? Give us a GitHub star or on this repo - it'll help us know better about how much interest is out there!

> [!NOTE]
> On language comparisons:
> * We accept that most computer languages (including Ruby) have both unique advantages and idiosyncracies
> * We view those differences as an opportunity to learn more about other computing environments
> * Perhaps also as insights to improve our own environment and langauge of choice
> * We recognise that users of other languages may choose to visit or join our meetup at any time, and try to ensure all attendees have a positive experience
> * **Therefore**: Constructive language comparisons are acceptable. "Bashing" of other languages is not.
